I have cracked what happned to last week. 
It was the large coffee I had before having dinner with you.
Because of that coffee, whole of my last week was wasted.
What happned was, due to coffee I had lots of dopamine generated 
and my brain got lot more reward while chatting with you then should have actually needed.
So I went into this illusion that I had one of the best evening of my life with this girl.
On the other hand, your brain just produced a normal domapine coz you had a 'good time'
Its great that you didnt drink coffee, other wise we would have been in illuion of l jaja
I mean dont get me wrong, I had a really good time (without caffine) too, but it had been some time
that I talked to a girl with fluent english, so it was new experince for sometime with lots of positive reward..
and thats where it went wrong.
its remarkable how these chemical changes shape our life.
I think this was happening in our modern world. we use drugs to bring our mind in illusion. -->breakups. Only those couples who really
enjoy each others presence stay togerter forever
I need to understand it more and one day I'll create the AI

I actually got bussiness idea by this experince (but not ethically right),
make an AI assistant (like siri, google assistant)
