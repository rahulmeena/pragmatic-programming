I have cracked what happned to last week. 
It was the large coffee I had before having dinner with you.
Because of that coffee, whole of my last week was wasted.
What happned was, due to coffee I had lots of dopamine generated 
and my brain got lot more reward while chatting with you then should have actually needed.
So I went into this illusion that I had one of the best evening of my life with this girl.
On the other hand, your brain just produced a normal domapine coz you had a 'good time'
Its great that you didnt drink coffee, other wise we would have been in illuion of l jaja
