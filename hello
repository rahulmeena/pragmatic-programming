Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur, India
Relevant Projects:
 Master Thesis: Detecting and Tracking Faces in Traffic Videos [May 2014 – Oct 2015]
- Developed a model to classify each video frame as foreground frame or background frame to reduced 50% of data.
- Detected possible faces using Haar-Cascade face detector and filtered through a trained classifier for skin detection.
- Extracted features of the remaining faces using fine-tuned AlexNet Deep CNN to build a binary SVM face classifier.
 Machine Learning Course Project / Kaggle Data Science Competition: Facial Keypoints Detection [Jan – Apr 2015]
- Carefully analyzed dataset to catch insights and applied necessary modifications in favor of following prediction models.
- Trained a single layer and then a double layer architecture neural network to improve RMSE score from 3.78 to 3.42.
- Built and trained a CNN with 3 convolutional and 2 FC layers to get RMSE score of 3.36(full data) and 2.95(filtered data).

 Artificial Intelligence Course Project: Penalty Kick by Humanoid Aldebaran Nao Robot [Jan – Apr 2013]
- Detected ball and goal by transforming to HSV color space.
- Used Inverse Kinematics and morphological operations to reach the ball and kick.
 Second Prize Winner at Yahoo! HackU 2013
- Built an app ‘DocPic Hunt’ which secured second prize among 80 different apps.
- Generated tags of an image by classifying it in Multi-Class SVM trained with SIFT features of more than hundred objects.
