I have taken bath with ganga water
you were different, I usually let little tiger use that energy 
next time I'll bring ganga jal so that your ticky mind dont feel 'uncomfortable' about it
or thats why I keep ganga jal in my room :p and 
you can take some if you are still feeling uncomfortable
you are talking to a tiger, I aware of all of these.
I was kind of sad coz th elittle tiger didnt show up, so acted like that, but usually bunnies send me those messages.
I am aware of these traps which evolution have set for us. But if you need to be best of best in your field one needs to be above these traps.
thats why, number of ONS are directly propotional to the GDP of the country jaja
