bar was "OK"
That was again easy to detect sarcasm. haha

"wont change your opinion about me". Can I know whats your opinion about me? Now that we are friends, it will be easy to be honest.

Yeah, I can understand that, its easy to feel lonely in new country which doesnt even speak your 2nd fluent language.

I was also feeling bit lost coz I recienved some set backs from my weekend research. I had the idea, also implemented it but results didnt came out as expected. So my paper writing was on halt, now still working on it. I need few papers to get good phd program.

I am good with being a friend.
It will be difficult for us anyway coz even our weekends donts aling. haha
And I need a friend to whome I can complain about football. All my friends are still hard-core followers.

countn sleep and bathroom mess - so i shouldnt talk to you after 10pm and shouldnt put a step in your room. Got it.

oh but the thing which makes me so sad is you just had mushrooms! and then you tried to sleep hungry at night. And I was just watching you struggling to sleep (after a uncessful mission).

I coulnt digest it and still cant, so I book the restaurant. And its not refundable (maybe partially). 
So it will mean a lot to me (as a friend) if you show up just for the dinner on saturday 6:30pm. You can come by your own and then leave by your own. I'll be back to Tainan same night and would feel like depth is settled.
