Hola Pari,
I have behaved naively in last week. Certainly not like tiger. Sorry about that(let me know if you are annoyed by bunny/tiger nomenclature).

Its just I missed chatting to you. I hope you dont think that I was being 'Horny Indian' like others you have met(not that I cant be when needed to jaja).

I think you arent talking to me coz you are afraid that I'll ask you out for dinner again jaja. Dont worry! I wont! Unless you are ready to split the bill like friends :p

oh, I got an idea earlier. Maybe you should set a target for me - like learn Spanish fluently or Salsa like an expert or just Chinese fluently, only then we can have a friendly dinner together. It will give me an extra motivation XD Kind of selfish idea though

Actually 1 evening dose of P is enough for me (atleast for few months). I had a good progress and productive weekend :).

Also I know that we cannot have anything serious. We live 70 miles apart and even our off days dont match.

You should get a taiwanese bf (a new unicornio). He will make your stay much more easier and can also teach you Chinese.

Or a spanish bf maybe. You wont feel homesick. (I wish not an Indian, I wont feel good about it XD)

But tinder is not the right place to find one. I am the best you can get on tinder jaja. 
Try to date anyone hot in your students(ofcourse after the intensive session is over)

Again I am sorry for getting on your nerves, the mess in bathroom and for making you uncomfortable on that morning. Never ment to. Just wants you to be happy.

I have again written so much :| I have so much to talk to you. But hope this time I will not get on your nerves. 

I'll be back to 3 messeges rule from tomorrow. I promise. To share nerdy topics like new discoveries by hydron collider, black holes or deep stuff in general.
-Raul
