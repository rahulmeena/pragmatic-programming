Bro, my football adventure didnt end with happy ending, but the journey has been super amazing.
I hope yours have the happy ending.
They both deserve the world cup, atleast one should realize it.
It will a beautiful story which will inspire future generations.
It will be a story of 2 heros - Messi, Ronaldo
Messi started the story by threatening the throne of Pele Maradona, and Ronaldo will finish it.
Ronaldo will be a supporting actor turned protagonist, Messi as protagonist turned supporting actor.
The story of Artist and Perfectionist
The story of Nature and Nurture
The story of two fucking GOATs
One GOAT will motivate future minds
Other GOAT will melt future hearts.
